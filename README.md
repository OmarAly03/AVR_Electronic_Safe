# AVR_Electronic_Safe

## Overview
This project involves the design and implementation of an electronic safe, featuring a robust security system that combines hardware and software components for enhanced functionality and user convenience. The key features of this electronic safe include an LCD display, a keypad, a servo motor for the locking mechanism, and Wi-Fi capability through an ESP01 module, enabling remote access via a web server.

## Features
**16x2 LCD Display (4-bit mode):** The LCD screen provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the safe, displaying status messages and prompts for the user.

**Keypad Input:** The keypad allows users to input their access code securely to lock or unlock the safe.

**Servo Motor Lock:** The servo motor serves as the locking mechanism, ensuring the safe can be securely locked and unlocked based on the correct input.
_ESP01 Wi-Fi Module:_ The ESP01 module provides Wi-Fi capability, allowing the safe to be controlled remotely. Users can open or close the safe directly from a web server, adding an extra layer of convenience.

## How It Works
**User Interaction:** The user interacts with the safe via the keypad to input their access code. The 16x2 LCD displays prompts and status messages to guide the user through the process.

**Lock/Unlock Mechanism:** Upon entering the correct code, the servo motor actuates to lock or unlock the safe.

**Remote Access:** Through the integrated ESP01 Wi-Fi module, users can connect to a web server to control the safe remotely. This feature allows for locking and unlocking the safe via an internet-connected device, providing flexibility and security even when the user is not physically near the safe.

## Applications
This electronic safe project is ideal for applications requiring secure storage with both local and remote access capabilities. It can be used in homes, offices, and other settings where valuable items need to be protected and accessed conveniently.
